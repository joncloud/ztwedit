Tabs can now be closed by middle clicking on them.
The default window size of the main window has been increased to 640x480.  The window can still be resized to a minimum of 320x240.
The menu item "File\Close View" has been renamed to "File\Close Document."
Documents have been restricted to only be allowed to open once. For example the East Hyrule Overworld Map may not be opened more than once.

The tile layout for overworld maps can now be maintained. There are limitations based upon the ROM's data structure that allows only a certain amount of tiles to be used.  To accomodate this a warning is displayed if too many tiles are used.

New game values (e.g., starting crystals, items, lives, magic, techniques) can now be adjusted under View\New Game Values.
